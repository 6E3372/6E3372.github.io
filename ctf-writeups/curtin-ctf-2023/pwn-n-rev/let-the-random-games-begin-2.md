### Solution

This time, again, the number is not so random.

If we run the program many times, we will see a set of "random numbers" in random sequence.

So, to make things faster, I input `a` and it will show all five “random numbers”.

Copy n paste it in the next sequence, the first random number given is your guide of which set are you on.

I hope you understand.
