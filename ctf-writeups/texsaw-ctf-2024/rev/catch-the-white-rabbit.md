## Solution

The task is very simple. Catch the White Rabbit.

The catch is, we only have **100 value of stamina** only and it **drains quickly** when we trying to sprint.

So, we use Cheat Engine to solve this problem.

Search the address variable that stored the stamina value and change it to a higher number than 100.

A few adjusment done on my character position in-game, and we're good to go.

Just sprint towards the rabbit until the end of the hall and the rabbit will give us a flag.
