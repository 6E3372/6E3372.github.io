* multitple stations (48-bit MAC Address)
* shared transmission medium
* CSMA-based Medium Access Control protocol
* comparable data rates

</details>

<details>

<summary>Difference with LAN</summary>

* wireless
* mobile stations
* half-duplex
* hidden node
* CSMA/CA
* multiple data transmission rate

</details>

<details>

<summary>Applications of WLAN</summary>

* LAN extension
* Cross building interconnect
* Nomadic access
* Ad Hoc network

</details>

<details>

<summary>Element of WLAN</summary>

* AP
* Wifi cards
* Safeguards

</details>

<details>

<summary>802.11 Topology</summary>

* Basic Service Set (BSS)
* Extended Service Set (ESS)
* Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)
* Mesh Basic Service Set (MBSS)

</details>

<details>

<summary>When to use MANET?</summary>

* No infra available
* too expensive to set up
* no time to set up

</details>

<details>

<summary>Problem of MANET</summary>

* Lack centreal entity
* Limited range of wireless communication
* Mobility of participants
* Battery-operated entities

</details>

<details>

<summary>Ad Hoc network routing protocol</summary>

* Table Driven Protocols
  * require each node to maintain one or more tables to store routing info
* On Demand Protocols
  * flooding the network with Route Request packets
* Hybrid Protocols
  * combine proactive and reactive protocols

## Chapter 6

<details>

<summary>WWAN features</summary>

* faster speed
* IEEE 802.16 standard
* more distance, less throughput
* covers wide geographical area
* uses celullar network

</details>

<details>

<summary>WWAN Characteristics</summary>

* reduced transmission speed
* wireless
* best security because 128-bit encryption

</details>

<details>

<summary>WWAN Advantages</summary>

* fewer signal problems
* cost effective
* flexible
* quick deployment
* global wireless coverage

</details>

<details>

<summary>WWAN Disadvantages</summary>

* replacement of lost WWAN may be costly
* connection interruption is high
* limited due to mobile device
* can be interuppted by external agents like bad climate

</details>

## Chapter 7

<details>

<summary>Why satelite communication?</summary>

* greater distance coverage
* directly connect points seperated by 1000's of miles
* reached from ground facilities that move
* adapt easily to changing requirement

</details>

<details>

<summary>Pros</summary>

* more coverage area
* transmission cost is independent of coverage area
* more bandwidth and broadcasting possibilities

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cons</summary>

* launching satelites is costly
* propagation delay increase
* difficult to repair
* congestion of frequencies

</details>

<details>

<summary>Applications of satelite communications</summary>

* radio broadcasting
* tv broadcasting
* GPS applications
* remote sensing
* weather condition monitoring

</details>

<details>

<summary>Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)</summary>

* 35863 km above earth surface
* same speed as earth rotates

</details>

<details>

<summary>Advantages of GEO</summary>

* large coverage area
* 24 hours view of particular area
* ideal for multipoint applications

</details>

<details>

<summary>Disadvantage of GEO</summary>

* weak signal and time delay
* difficulty broadcasting signals to near polar regions

</details>

<details>

<summary>Low Earth Orbit (LEO)</summary>

* 500-1500 km above earth
* don's stay in fixed position

</details>

<details>

<summary>Advantage of LEO</summary>

* better signal strength
* less time delay

</details>

<details>

<summary>Disadvantage of LEO</summary>

* a network for it might be costly
* atmospheric drag effect LEO satelites

</details>

<details>

<summary>Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)</summary>

* 8000-18000 km above earth
* visible for longer period than LEO

</details>

<details>

<summary>Advantage of MEO</summary>

* longer duration of visibility

</details>

<details>

<summary>Disadvantage of MEO</summary>

* longer time delay
* weaker signal

</details>

### WLAN Deployment Planning

1. Coverage Oriented

* to provide max WLAN coverage with least amount of AP
* allow more user to utilize WLAN
* characteristics
  * low packet rate
  * low bandwidth
  * ease of maintenance
* deployed in
  * warehouse
  * retail outlet
  * small or medium offices

2. Capacity Oriented

* to provide max throughput
* area must have
  * high packet rate
  * latency sensitive
  * smaller-sized subnet
  * dense client population
