# Designing Models for Addressing and Numbering

## Guidelines for Addressing and Naming

* Use a structured model for addressing and naming
* Assign addresses and names hierarchically
* Decide in advance if you will use
  * Central or distributed authority for addressing and naming
  * Public or private addressing
  * Static or dynamic addressing and naming

## Advantage

It makes it easier to

* Read network maps
* Operate network management software
* Recognize devices in protocol analyzer traces
* Meet goals for usability
* Design filters on firewalls and routers
* Implement route summarization

## Designing Networks with Subnets

* Determining subnet size
* Computing subnet mask
* Computing IP addresses

### Why subnets?

* To efficiently use IP addresses
* To reduce the number of collisions
* To reduce broadcasting traffic
* To strengthen network security control
* To implement the network structure at the site, building, department, and office levels
* To reduce the cost of paying the ISP for public IP addresses

## Guidelines for Assigning Names

* Names should be
  * Short
  * Meaningful
  * Unambiguous
  * Distinct
  * Case insensitive
* Avoid names with unusual characters
  * Hyphens, underscores, asterisks, and so on
