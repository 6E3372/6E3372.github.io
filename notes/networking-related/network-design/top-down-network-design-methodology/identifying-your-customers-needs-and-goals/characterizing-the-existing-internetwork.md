# Characterizing the Existing Internetwork

## **Step 1.**&#x20;

**Identify all existing organization information and documentation.**

What to look at?

* Look for site information eg. site name, site address, access room
* Get network infrastructure information eg. LAN wiring, power used
* Logical network information eg. IP addressing, routing protocols

## **Step 2.**

**Perform a network audit that adds detail to the description of the network.**

The network audit should provide the following information:

* Network device list
* Hardware models
* Software versions
* Interface speeds
* Configuration of network devices
* Auditing tools output information
* Link, CPU, and memory utilization
* WAN technology types and carrier information

## **Step 3.**

**Use traffic analysis information to augment information on applications and protocols used.**

To obtain application-level information, the IP packet needs to be further inspected.

* Check the Health of the Existing Internetwork
* Analyze network availability
* Analyze network utilization
* Bandwidth utilization by protocols
* Analyze delay and response time
* Check the status of major routers, switches and firewall
