### Solution

Same as before, but this time, the program will give us a long and random number, looping from 100000000 - 999999999.

As i know, it has two ways of solving this challenge.

1. Bruteforce.
2. My Own way

Actually, i don't know how to explain it well. I think I just got lucky.

Btw, for the author for this challenge, can you explain it to me please XD

This is how i solve it.

I put `12345678` for the first input.

`12345678-123` in the second and suddenly the “random number” is constant until the end.

So, i copy the number and paste it in the input after.
